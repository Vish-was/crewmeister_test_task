# Following points have been done
1. Show the list of absences including the names of the employees.
2. Show the first 10 absences, with the ability to paginate.
3. Show the total number of absences.
4. For each absence I show the Member name, Type of absence, Period, Member note (when available), Status (can be 'Requested', 'Confirmed' or 'Rejected'), Admitter note (when available).
5. I add the filter functionality for the absences by type.
6. I add the filter functionality for the absences by date.
7. Show the loading state until the list is available.
8. Show the error state if the list is unavailable.
9. Show the empty state if there are no results.
10. Generate the iCal file.
11. Implement the redux for the state management.
12. Implement the styled-component for the UI.

2. In Navbar component I cover branch, statements, functions, lines.
3. In Filter component I cover  statements, functions, branch, lines
4. In Absences component I cover  statements, lines, functions, branch.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
